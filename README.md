# ReactNativeBoiler

'''
So here is the story of a painful evening.
I tried to use a template, and install the obvious components, vimeo, googlecast, etc.
Something crashed it all, so I decided to build from the ground up adding a layer at a time to figure it out.

In the end I had to find a way around vimeo, and for the sake of deadlines, there are still lots of issues.
1) The video starts right away on start up.
2) Probably other things as well...

...

Also note that I do not have a google chrome TV, so I could not test the google cast as far as I could tell and setting up VMs to talk is something I ran out of time to do.
.  Hope it works.
There are a lot of little things in the package, and definitely something that needs to probably be cleaned up, when time allows.

Note: I am starting this off as a project, since my last template was owned by my previous employer.  I would like to find some common interest and people to help work on it.  We can discuss.

I intend to covert this library to TypeScript, and put a lot more validation behind it.
My idea is to have multiple common setups in branches to allow you to  merge a few branches for what you need and run with it.
This way you can avoid making mistakes or having issues editing the various files for builds/etc.  With some of hte more complicated mergers as special branches.
